### **"Tang Kitchen Nightmares" – A Snobby Poet’s Guide to Fixing Modern Food**  
**Objective:** Students take on the role of a **Tang Dynasty culinary critic** tasked with "refining" a modern dish to meet elite 8th-century standards.  

---

### **1. The Challenge: "This Dish Offends the Emperor’s Palate!"**  
Present students with a "vulgar" modern dish (e.g., **cheeseburger, instant ramen, pizza**). Their job: **rebrand it as Tang haute cuisine** by applying:  
- **Poetic renaming**  
- **Seasonal ingredients**  
- **Artful presentation**  
- **A backstory fit for a scholar**  

---

### **Example: "Saving" a Cheeseburger**  
**Current (Barbarian) Name:** *"Double Bacon Cheeseburger"*  
**Problems:**  
- **Greasy, chaotic** (Tang food is *composed*).  
- **No chopstick elegance** (finger food = peasant fare).  
- **Lacks seasonal harmony** (where’s the poetry?).  

**Tang Poet’s Redesign:**  
- **New Name:** *"Golden Grain Pillow with Jade Dairy and Smoke-Kissed Swine"*  
  (金穀枕夾玉乳燻豚 *jīn gǔ zhěn jiā yù rǔ xūn tún*)  
- **Changes:**  
  - Replace bun with **steamed lotus-leaf buns** (scented, elegant).  
  - Swap beef for **thin-sliced, wine-marinated pork belly** (carved like "mountain clouds").  
  - Cheese becomes **fermented bean-curd cream** (a Tang-approved umami touch).  
  - Serve with **a single, perfect plum blossom** on the side (because *aesthetics*).  
- **Backstory:** *"Inspired by the dreams of a drunken poet who longed for the simplicity of rural feasts... yet refined for the imperial palate."*

### **2. Student Activity: "Rescue This Dish!"**  
**Assign one of these "problem" foods to small groups:**  
1. **Instant Ramen** → *Too "hasty."* Must become a **meditative monk’s noodle soup**.  
2. **Chocolate Bar** → *Too "cloying."* Must be **reborn as a medicinal spice-infused dessert**.  
3. **Hot Dog** → *Too "phallic."* Must be **transformed into a minced-lotus sausage**.  

**Worksheet Prompts:**  
- *"What seasonal ingredient elevates this dish?"*  
- *"What poetic name hides its barbarian origins?"*  
- *"How would a Tang chef plate this on jade?"*  

---

### **3. The Grand Taste Test (Tang-Style)**  
Students present their redesigned dishes with:  
- **A haiku-style "ode" to the food** (e.g., *"Autumn’s first breeze / whispers through wheat strands / ah, the pork trembles"*).  
- **A dramatic backstory** (e.g., *"This recipe was stolen from a Persian sorcerer—but improved!"*).  

**Judging Criteria:**  
- **Historical plausibility** (Would a Tang noble eat this?).  
- **Poetic pretentiousness** (Extra points for nature metaphors.).  
- **Aesthetic ruthlessness** (No messy fingerprints!).

### **4. "Kitchen Nightmares" Twist: Gordon Ramsay vs. Li Bai**  
- **Gordon’s Feedback:** *"This burger is so raw, it’s writing Tang poetry!"*  
- **Li Bai’s Feedback:** *"Your noodles lack the melancholy of a willow in winter. 2/5 stars."*  

---

### **Why It’s Genius**  
- **Critical Thinking:** Forces students to **analyze cultural values** through food.  
- **Creativity:** Rewriting junk food as art is **hilariously educational**.  
- **Empathy:** Tang snobs were just ancient food bloggers—kids will *relate*.  

**Bonus:** Film a **"Tang Dynasty Cooking Show"** where students narrate their recipes in over-the-top poetic Mandarin.
