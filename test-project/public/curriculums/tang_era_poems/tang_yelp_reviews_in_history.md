### **"Worst Yelp Reviews in Tang History"**  
*A Handout of Real Historical Complaints from Tang Dynasty Elites*  

---

#### **1. "This So-Called 'Western' Grape Wine is Donkey Piss"**  
**📜 Source**: Tang scholar Liu Zongyuan (柳宗元) mocking Central Asian wine  
**⭐ Rating**: 1/5  
**🍷 Review**:  
*"They call this 'wine'? It reeks of fermented horse sweat and stings the tongue like a scorpion's tail! A true gentleman drinks only the mellow rice wines of Jiangnan. These barbarians have no subtlety—only vulgar strength."*  
**🏷️ Tag**: *#StickToTea*  

---

#### **2. "Persian Pastries: Too Sweet, Like a Child's Dessert"**  
**📜 Source**: Tang court records criticizing Central Asian sweets  
**⭐ Rating**: 2/5  
**🍬 Review**:  
*"The 'honey cakes' of Persia are cloying as syrup-drenched snow. A single bite clings to the teeth like an overeager concubine. Where is the balance? The restraint? Give me a simple mooncake any day."*  
**🏷️ Tag**: *#SugarIsForBabies*

#### **3. "Tibetan Butter Tea: A Crime Against Tea Culture"**  
**📜 Source**: Tang diplomats disgusted by Himalayan butter tea  
**⭐ Rating**: 0/5  
**🍵 Review**:  
*"They defile sacred tea leaves by churning them with rancid yak butter! The result is a greasy, salty abomination that coats the mouth like candle wax. Is this some cruel joke? In Chang'an, we brew tea pure—like the mountain mist itself."*  
**🏷️ Tag**: *#TeaHeresy*  

---

#### **4. "Korean Kimchi: Rotten Vegetables for Peasants"**  
**📜 Source**: Tang aristocrats sneering at fermented Korean side dishes  
**⭐ Rating**: 1/5  
**🥬 Review**:  
*"The Koreans bury their vegetables in jars like corpses and call it 'cuisine'? The stench alone could wilt a peony. A true scholar’s palate demands freshness—not this peasant survival food."*  
**🏷️ Tag**: *#WhyNotJustPickleProperly*  

---

#### **5. "Indian Curry: A Chaotic Spice Storm"**  
**📜 Source**: Tang Buddhist monks complaining after visiting India  
**⭐ Rating**: 2/5 (but secretly addicted)  
**🍛 Review**:  
*"The Indians toss every spice known to man into a single pot, creating a riot of flavors that overwhelms the senses. Yet... I confess, the 'garam masala' lingers in the mind like a forbidden verse. Still, it’s no properly balanced *luóhàn zhāi* (Buddhist vegetarian feast)."*  
**🏷️ Tag**: *#SpiceOverload*

### **Classroom Discussion Questions:**  
1. **Bias Check**: Why did Tang elites judge foreign foods so harshly? (Hint: Cultural superiority + unfamiliar flavors.)  
2. **Modern Parallels**: Can you think of foods today that people unfairly mock for being "weird"?  
3. **Defending the Dish**: Pick one of these reviews and write a **rebuttal** from the offended culture’s perspective!
