### **Tang Poet’s Yelp Review: A Snobby Food Critic from the 8th Century**  
**Objective:** Students write hilarious (but historically plausible) "Yelp reviews" of modern foods from the perspective of a judgmental Tang Dynasty scholar.  

---

### **1. Introduce the Concept**  
- Explain that Tang elites were **foodies** who wrote poems about meals.  
- Show examples of Tang food critiques:  
  - A real Tang poet once complained about *"vulgar Northern wine"* tasting like "donkey piss."  
  - Another praised a delicate dish as *"a dream woven by the Kitchen God."*

### **2. Sample Reviews (For Inspiration)**  

#### **🍣 Sushi Bar – ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 Stars)**  
*"The sea’s jewels, laid upon pearled rice—each slice a testament to the knife-wielder’s divine skill. No coarse flames violated this fish; its purity rivals the morning dew. Pair it with warmed chrysanthemum wine, and one might forget the vulgarity of… lesser kingdoms."*  
- **Suggested Tag:** *#NoBarbariansAllowed*  

#### **🍔 Hamburger – ⭐ (1/5 Stars)**  
*"A lump of minced mystery, haphazardly crushed between wilted wheat flaps. No chopsticks! No dignity! The ‘cheese’ oozes like a sickly river, and the pickles mock the very concept of harmony. Only a drunkard or a Western horseman would consume this… if they had no access to proper *baozi*."*  
- **Suggested Tag:** *#BringBackCivilization*  

#### **🍕 Pizza – ⭐⭐ (2/5 Stars, But Reluctant)**  
*"At first glance: a tragic waste of flour, smothered in chaotic toppings. Yet… the ‘tomato’ (a bizarre foreign fruit) has a tang that lingers like a lover’s quarrel. If one scrapes off the excess, folds it neatly, and pretends it’s a *hu pastry*, it’s… tolerable. But why not just eat a proper scallion pancake?"*  
- **Suggested Tag:** *#ExoticButFlawed*  

#### **🌮 Taco Truck – ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5 Stars, For Adventurous Eaters)**  
*"A crumpled corn shell, cradling reckless abandon. The ‘avocado’ is suspiciously buttery, like a scholar’s inkstone gone rogue. Yet, the lime’s zing dances on the tongue like a court dancer’s sleeve. Warning: Eating this in public requires a fan to hide one’s shame."*  
- **Suggested Tag:** *#StreetFoodForTheBrave*

### **3. Student Activity: Write Your Own!**  
**Instructions:**  
- Pick a modern food.  
- Rate it 1-5 stars from a Tang poet’s perspective.  
- Use **Tang-style insults or praise** (nature metaphors, foreigner disdain, elegance obsession).  
- Optional: Add a **pretentious hashtag**.  

**Example Framework:**  
> *"This [food] is like [poetic comparison]. The [ingredient] offends/stuns like [natural phenomenon]. [Final verdict]."*  

**Food Ideas:** Hot dogs, ramen, cereal, bubble tea, chocolate, ketchup.  

---

### **4. Share & Vote**  
- Students read reviews aloud in a **haughty Tang scholar voice**.  
- Vote: *Which review is the most creatively savage?*  

---

### **Why It’s Fun & Educational**  
- **Critical Thinking:** Students analyze cultural bias (why Tang elites judged foreign things).  
- **Creative Writing:** Forces them to **think in metaphors**, like real Tang poets.  
- **Humor:** Absurdity makes history stick.  

**Extension Idea:** Have students **defend the "barbarian" food** as a foreign merchant trying to sell it to Tang nobles!
