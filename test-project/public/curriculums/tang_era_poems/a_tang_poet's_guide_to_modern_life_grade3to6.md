**Grade Level:** 3–6  
**Subject:** History/Creative Writing  
**Duration:** 45–60 minutes  

#### **Objective:**  
Students will learn about Tang Dynasty culture, poetry, and aesthetics by imagining how a Tang-era scholar might describe modern objects (like coffee, smartphones, or cars) in poetic, historically plausible ways.

### **Lesson Outline**  

#### **1. Warm-Up: "What Would a Tang Poet Say?" (10 min)**  
- Show students a picture of a modern item (e.g., a coffee cup, a bicycle, a pizza).  
- Ask: *"If a Tang poet saw this, how might they describe it?"*  
- Introduce the idea of **creative metaphors**—e.g., coffee as *"Western burnt-bean broth" (西焦豆湯 xī jiāo dòu tāng)*.  

#### **2. Mini-Lesson: Tang Dynasty Aesthetics (10 min)**  
- Discuss key Tang cultural elements:  
  - **Poetry:** Short, elegant, nature-inspired.  
  - **Foreign Influences:** Persia, India, Central Asia (e.g., "exotic" things were called *胡 hú—"barbarian"*).  
  - **Tea Culture:** Poets loved tea, so how would they react to coffee?  
- Show real Tang poems (e.g., Li Bai’s drinking verses) for inspiration.  

#### **3. Activity: "Tang Poet’s Journal" (20 min)**  
- Students pick a modern object and "translate" it into Tang-style names/poems.  
  - Example:  
    - **Smartphone →** *"Jade-Lattice Messenger" (玉格傳音 yù gé chuán yīn)*  
    - **Pizza →** *"Barbarian Flattened Cake" (胡扁餅 hú biǎn bǐng)*  
- Worksheet prompts:  
  - *"Describe your object like it’s from a faraway land."*  
  - *"Compare it to nature (e.g., 'as round as the moon')."*  

#### **4. Share & Perform (10 min)**  
- Students read their creations aloud in a dramatic "poet’s voice."  
- Optional: Act out a **"Tang Dynasty Coffeehouse"** where they order imaginary items in character.  

#### **5. Wrap-Up: Why Does This Matter? (5 min)**  
- Discuss: *"How does looking at modern life through ancient eyes help us understand history?"*  
- Highlight how Tang China was global and creative—just like today!
