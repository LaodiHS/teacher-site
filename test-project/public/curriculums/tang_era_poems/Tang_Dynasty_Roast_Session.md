# 🏯 The Ultimate Tang Dynasty Roast Session  
## Savage Scholars Mock Modern Life

**Grade Level:** 3–6  
**Subject:** History / Creative Writing  
**Duration:** 45–60 minutes  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Students will learn about Tang Dynasty culture, aesthetics, and poetry by ruthlessly—and hilariously—reinterpreting modern Western items through the judgmental eyes of a Tang poet. Expect ancient poetic elitism with high-level snark.

---

## 📚 Lesson Outline

### 1. **Warm-Up: “The Tang Poet’s Culture Shock”** (10 min)
Show absurd modern Western items (e.g., a hamburger, skateboard, laptop).  
Ask:  
> "If a Tang poet encountered this, would they be amazed, confused, or physically repulsed?"

**Examples:**
- **Hamburger:** “Barbarian minced-cake wrapped in wilted leaves? Where are the chopsticks?”  
- **Skateboard:** “A wooden wheel-less chariot for reckless youths? How uncouth!”  

---

### 2. **Mini-Lesson: Tang Elite vs. Exotic Oddities** (10 min)
Explain the worldview of the Tang Dynasty:

- **Foreign = 胡 (hú)**: Used for Persians, Turks, Central Asians—meaning "barbarian."
- **Tang Cultural Superiority:**
  - Tea > coffee  
  - Silk > wool  
  - Calligraphy >... whatever the West was scribbling

**Historical Fun Fact:**  
Poets wrote: _“Their swirling robes are like drunken clouds!”_ about Central Asian dancers—yet still called them “exotic.”  

---

### 3. **Activity: The Tang Poet Roasts Modern Life** (20 min)
Students create Tang-style names and roast poems for modern Western items.

#### 📜 Worksheet Examples:

**Smartphone → “Jade Mirror of Distracted Minds” (迷心玉鏡 mí xīn yù jìng)**  
> _“A thousand li spoken, yet no mouth moves / A scroll brighter than the moon, yet no ink is used.”_

**Pizza → “Foreign Floppy Bread with Chaotic Toppings” (胡雜糅餅 hú zá róu bǐng)**  
> _“Round as the moon, but burdened with greasy treasures / A feast for barbarians, lacking refinement.”_

**Jeans → “Coarse Blue Servant-Pants” (粗藍傭褲 cū lán yōng kù)**  
> _“Stiff as peasant hemp, yet nobles wear them? / The West truly has no sense of silk.”_

---

### 4. **Share & Perform: Imperial Court Debates** (10 min)
- Split into Tang Scholars vs. Clueless Foreigners.
- Merchants "sell" a modern item.
- Scholars respond with savage poetic takedowns.

**Example Battle:**  
> **Foreigner:** "Behold this ‘Rainbow Unicorn Frappuccino’!"  
> **Scholar:** “A drink for delirious children!  
> Colors of a vomited rainbow—  
> Did a dye merchant explode?”  

---

### 5. **Wrap-Up: Why Did the Tang Think They Were Fancy?** (5 min)
**Discussion Prompts:**
- “Is it fair for the Tang to call others ‘barbarians’?”  
- “What modern things might Tang poets actually love?” (Hint: Probably sushi.)

## 🙇 Why It Works
- **Historical Accuracy:** Tang poets *actually* roasted foreign items (e.g., 胡萄 “barbarian grapes”).  
- **Humor-Driven Engagement:** Tang snobbery = pure comedic gold.  
- **Cross-Disciplinary:** Merges creative writing, cultural history, and satire.  

---

**Would a Tang poet approve?** Probably not. But they'd *definitely* write a poem about it.
